# better-bhop-trainer

A better server side bhop strafe trainer for CS:S

This plugin is a remastered version of the OG [strafe trainer](https://github.com/PaxPlay/bhop-strafe-trainer/) by PaxPlay

The rework addresses odd implementations in the old strafe trainer code and also adds lacking features

- Prespeed indicator
- "Target" strafe speed trainer (under development)
- User preferences (in future)
- Different style of strafe speed indicator (in future)
